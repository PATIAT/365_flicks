        	<br>
        	<p>The whole 365 thing started as a blog called 365 Flicks (Duh!)! The blog was a place for hosts Kev and Chris to vent their many frustrations and rant away until their hearts were content over the latest Hollywood blockbuster or gush over the rare good ones. It all began with Kev's ill fated attempted the 365 challenge where you watch a movie everyday for one whole year! He made it to 97 movies so it wasn't the most successful attempt ever made. Chris would add his rantiness to the blog and was the special reports / Jonah Jamison type guy bigging up his favourite shows such as Firefly, Sopranos and the like...
			<br>
		  	<h4>So, why the podcast you may ask us?</h4>
			Well... it was obvious progression from our point of view. There we were watching/talking over Jedi or Empire and Kev put the idea to Chris about a podcast based around all the things they love most. Movies, TV, Games and Comics. So, a mic was borrowed from firends, episode 00 was recorded and the rest as they say is history (in the making)!
